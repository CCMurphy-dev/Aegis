// Note: SwipeableSpaceContainer, SwipeDetectorRepresentable, and SwipeDetectorView
// are already defined in SpaceIndicatorView.swift
// This file is kept for organizational purposes but doesn't redefine them
// to avoid duplicate declaration errors.
//
// If you need to use these components in the refactored code, they will be
// available from the original SpaceIndicatorView.swift file.
